the question is to make a php form to fetch the data from the sql.
so to make a connection we have to use mysqli.
first we will create the table where columns are id, first_name, last_name and email.
then we will enter the details as shown in the question.
we are entering the multiple code so we have to use sql = "for the first code;"; and sql .="for the next code"; mysqli_multi_query to execute them
and this will end first <?php   ?>
then in next <?php  ?> we will enter the sql querry for the fetching of the data by descending order of first_name.
